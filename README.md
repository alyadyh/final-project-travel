## Disclaimer
Due to lack of time and knowledge, the GUI cannot be linked to the main program. However, the GUI is still being worked on in the form of fxml files and java programs which are stored separately from the main program. The GUI syntax is stored in the program's java file, but cannot be executed. However, the GUI is still included in reports and project files as proof of efforts to make a functional GUI.
